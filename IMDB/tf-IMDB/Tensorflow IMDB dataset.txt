In this classification problem/ sentiment analysis problem
we use the tensorflow imdb dataset.
This is a dataset for binary sentiment classification containing
substantially more data than previous benchmark datasets. It provides 
a set of 25,000 highly polar movie reviews for training, and 25,000 for testing. 
There is additional unlabeled data for use as well.

More information about the dataset can be obtained from the following
